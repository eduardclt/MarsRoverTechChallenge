## Instalation 

There are nothing that needs to be installed. Simply clone or download the project files and open index.html in your broweser.

## Usage

1. Enter the size of the platue on the first screen. (eg 10, 10)
2. You'll now see two forms. One for generating a rover and the second one is to control a rover.
3. Insert the an x and y coordinate and the orientation of a rover you would like to add. (eg 3, 4, N)
4. In the table that's now generated you can find the rovers ID that is used to select and control it.
5. In the bottom form type the ID of the rover you which to move and the commands that it should follow. (eg MRRLM)
(Please note, if the commands will be excuted until the rover goes out of bounds. This will stop the exucution)
